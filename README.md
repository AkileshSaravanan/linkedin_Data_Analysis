## Motivation
As an active user on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/Akilesh--S) with more than 1000 connections, I was curious about the statistics of my network. 
In particular, I was wondering about these questions:

> What are the segments of people in my network?

> Do most of the people in my network work in data science related field?

In this project, I will go through how I utilized exploratory analysis and data visualizations to answer these questions and gain insights from my own LinkedIn data.

## Data
To analyze and visualize my network, the first step that I need to do is to get my LinkedIn data. 
All I need to do is just select which data I want to get and it will be downloaded as a CSV file.

Here are the first few rows from the Connections.csv file that I've downloaded:

The DataFrame above contains data about the current positions and companies of people in my network as well as when the date I connect to that person.

## Key Findings

### Number of Connections on a Given Date
> How many connections did I make in a given date?

From the line plot above, we can see that there is a peak in the number of connections per day on 13 December 2021. It also seems that December 2021 is the period when I was the most active on LinkedIn.

### Top Companies/Organizations in my Network
> Which companies/organizations do the people in my network mainly come from?

Using the treemap above, it is easier to compare the proportion of one company/organization to the others. It looks like the largest proportion of my network are from my university.

### Top Positions in my Network
> What are the top common positions of people in my network?
